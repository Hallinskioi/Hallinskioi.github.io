# Portfolio-Website

# INTRO
Prior to Git integration this project had been worked for a couple of hours. Basic website design is being copied from my Wix website. 
Expansions include adding a Web Dev page with more example projects including 'Every Single World'. All these sites are aiming to be hosted by Github pages.
I also own the 'hallinskioi.com' domain.

# MARK UP AND LANGUAGES

So far this project is coded in HTML5, CSS3 and has additional scripts written in JavaScript ES6.
