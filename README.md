# Portfolio-Website

# INTRO
Prior to Git integration this project had been worked for a couple of hours. Basic page setup is being lifted from my previous Portfolio website built with Wix.com. 
This site aims to link to all of my portfolio work related to web development and video games. This site will be hosted by GitHub Pages.
I also own the 'hallinskioi.com' domain and will link them.

# MARK UP AND LANGUAGES

So far this project is coded in HTML5, CSS3 and has additional scripts written in JavaScript ES6.

# FUTURE WORK

I intend to expand on my Blog section as it is currently under-utilised.
